# VCAPF build notes

It's a standard build. No errors to note. Nothing weird to explain. Just build it.

Oh, the two transistors in principle should be [matched](https://web.archive.org/web/20151002134800if_/http://home.comcast.net/~ijfritz/MiscProj/transmat001.pdf). In practice you'd probably never know the difference. I put the first two 2N3906 I could find in the matching circuit, measured a voltage difference of 0.4 mV, and figured there was no point in looking at a third transistor.

There are holes provided for attaching the two boards together with spacers, but since both boards are attached to the front panel, this isn't really necessary.
